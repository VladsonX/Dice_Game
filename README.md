This is a Dice Game which you can play with your friend.

Code randomly generates the amount of circles on a certain dice (from 1 to 6), and then depending on a number of circles that each player has, write, who's the winner.

There are 3 cases of the end of the each game: Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, Draw.

Depending on who's the winner, the background of each dice changes on a "winner background" or a "loser background". The title, which writes, who is a winner gets the unique player's color.
